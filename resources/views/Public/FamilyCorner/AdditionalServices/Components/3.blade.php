                        Placing transferees in <span class="text-color-red">temporary apartments offers your company savings</span> over booking them in hotel rooms. Our apartments are less expensive per night than extended stay hotel rooms, and you won't have to pay the service taxes required at hotels, since every apartment has a complete kitchen, you won't have to pay restaurant prices for every meal.

                        Temporary apartments are even <span class="text-color-red">more cost-efective</span> when transferees are relocating with their families. An entire family can be comfortably accommodated in one apartment, instead of in multiple hotel rooms.
