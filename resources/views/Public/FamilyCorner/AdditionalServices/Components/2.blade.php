                    <p>The advantages and benefits of renting furniture, home ware and appliances are limitless. Are you
                        and your family faced with the need to live for a limited period away from your country where
                        you don't already have a home or where your home isn't ready yet? What are the options?</p>

                                        short stay, and can be stressful especially for other family members.</a></li>

                                        expensive.</a></li>

                                        furniture and household goods that come with it probably wonÂ´t be what you have
                                        chosen.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#"> Renting unfurnished accommodation and buying the necessary
                                        contents takes time and involves major capital outlay.</a></li>

                    <div class="padding-top-20"></div>
                    <p>For short and medium stays it can be more economic and less stressful than shipping your own
                        furniture here.</p>
                    <div class="padding-top-20"></div>
                    <p>For longer stays, is also a good option on <span class="text-color-red">reducing the gap</span>
